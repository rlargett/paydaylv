            <p><strong>Late Payments</strong><br>There are numerous cash advance <a href="https://www.paydaylv.com" title="Payday Loans">payday loans</a> lenders who are a part of our network but follow different late payment policies. It is up to you to read through and understand their policies prior to appending a digital signature in order to constitute your legal obligation to pay back the loan. However, the state laws in some places will determine how much late fees a lender can charge.</p>
            <p><strong>Loan Extensions</strong><br>The state laws will determine if a lender can grant a rollover or an extension. There are some states that allow many rollovers and there are some that forbid this practice all together.</p>
            <p>People who are late with their payment actually permit the lender to charge them late fees and make a request for immediate payment of the balance amount. If the person defaults, he or she is subjected to more fees as previously described in the agreement they signed. You should calculate your repayment before accepting the loan. Even though these loans are convenient they can cause lots of distress if not repaid.</p>
            <p>Lenders belonging to Community Financial Services Association of America have been permitted to provide borrowers with an extended payment plan once every 12 months.</p>
            <p><strong>Loan Default</strong><br>Lenders which are a part of 's network will pursue collections after the due date has passed to the fullest extent of the law. There will be criminal charges in addition to fees which could apply if the loan is not repaid.</p>
            <p>However, if the lender is a part of CFSA you'll be saved being levied criminal charges on.</p>
