        <h1 class="article-title">How Online Personal Loans Work</h1>
        <div class="article-p">
            <p>This is a lender-matching service which primary goal is to connect consumers like you with personal loan lenders.  We can successfully match a great part of individuals who submit request a lender willing to provide the funds they need. </p>
            <p><strong>All About Personal Loans </strong></p>
            <p><i>Our Secure Online Form Submitting is Fast and Free </i></p>
            <p>The online form we provide only takes minutes to fill out, is completely secured with top-notch security software, and is free for you to fill out. We only ask for the information we need to match you with a lender in our network, and after you submit this information, it is forwarded to our lenders who can provide you with up to $3,000 in cash in as little as one business day. In many cases, you will not be asked to fax a single document. </p>
            <p><i>Review the No-Obligation Offers </i></p>
            <p>In a matter of minutes after we have processed your information, you can be matched with one of our lenders and can get an offer that suits your requirements and your details. You are never under obligations to accept any offer, so if the offer you receive is not satisfactory, you can simply reject it, and it will cost you nothing. </p>
            <p><i>Getting Your Cash </i></p>
            <p>After getting the offer that suits your financial needs, you will go through the details of your loan agreement. Then, your lender will ask you to provide your electronic signature in order to enter into a contract. Once this step has been completed, your lender will usually deposit the loan amount for which you were approved into your checking account on the following business day. </p>
            <p><i>Repaying Your Loan </i></p>
            <p>Some of our lenders can make the loan repayment process incredibly simple. If you opt for the direct withdrawal option while closing your loan agreement, you can have the repayment done for you electronically. In most cases, all you will need to do in order to repay your loan is to ensure that your monthly repayment  amounts—the amount of the loan plus any applicable fees and interest—is available  for withdrawal on the scheduled dates. This way, you do not have to mail any  checks or money orders and you do not have to visit a retail location. This  paperless process also helps to reduce the likelihood of late payments and may  even save you money. </p>
            <p><strong>Personal Loan Qualifications </strong></p>
            <p>Qualifying for a personal loan is simple and quite fast. These are the basic  qualifications associated with obtaining a personal loan:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You must be 18 years of age or older</li>
                <li>You must legally live and work in the United States</li>
                <li>You must be employed with the same employer for a minimum of 90 days</li>
                <li>You must have a bank account that is not currently overdrawn</li>
                <li>You must have a valid email address and working telephone number</li>
                <li>You must meet minimum income requirements</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Your Credit History Is Usually Not the Critical Issue</strong></p>
            <p>Even though the lenders that partner with us do perform credit checks if necessary, individuals with imperfect credit or no credit at all usually can qualify for loans anyway. The lenders in our network may also perform alternative credit checks with the companies like TeleTrack or DP. These verifications help to ensure that you are not currently in bankruptcy and that you do not have outstanding loans with other lenders. These checks usually do not affect your credit score. </p>
            <p><strong>Getting the Biggest Benefit from Personal Loans </strong></p>
            <p>In order to truly enjoy the benefits associated with personal loans, it is important for you to repay your loan on time. This will help you to avoid potentially high late fees and build a better business relationship with your lender of choice. You should always ensure that you will have the funds available to repay your loan before you request a loan, and you should contact your lender immediately to discuss the available options if you will be unable to repay your loan on time. </p>
            <p><strong>How We Can Help </strong></p>
            <p>We are always available to answer your questions about this website, our services and personal loans in general. We strive to provide you with outstanding customer support and will answer your inquiries as quickly as possible. If you have issues with any particular loan deal with one of our lenders, please, contact that lender directly, because we are not authorized to have details regarding any loan agreement you've entered.</p>
