                this Privacy Policy. All the information You provide is protected by our top

                interest in. Your submission of the information is considered as an expressed

                use Your information only upon Your expressed consent You give while clicking
                the respective button or ticking the box of consent, which authorizes us to use
                Your information as set herein. </p>
            <p>Some of Your PII (excluding SS number and other sensitive information such as
                banking information) can be shared with some third parties we contract with in
                case technical support is needed. These authorized third parties are liable for
                keeping Your information secure and in no way can use it for any other purpose
                but the purposes authorized according to the agreement we make, as well as are
                in no way authorized to share Your information with other third parties. All the
                activity performed with Your PII is bounded by the provisions of this Privacy
                Policy and respective formal documents on this Website, as well as the
                provisions of applicable international laws and the legislation of the USA.
                Additionally, PII can be shared for consumer reporting with credit bureaus upon
                Your prior authorization (consumer reporting authorization). However, this
                procedure is performed by the lenders in a prerogative way, thus, regulated by
                the legal documents concerning Your communication with Your lender and other
                financial providers and has nothing to do with this agreement and the use of
                this Site and its services.</p>
            <p>Your PII can be shared with governmental entities, disclosed completely or
                partially upon request from any authority or authorized organization if such
                disclosure is lawful and considered necessary for these reasons: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>it is ordered or required to comply with the legal processes;</li>
                <li>it is obligatory to protect the property of the owner of the Website or its
                    affiliates and in no way contradicts applicable laws;
                </li>
                <li>it is necessary to prevent crime and/or protect national security;</li>
                <li>it is necessary to protect personal or public safety.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In case of merging, acquisition, consolidation or purchase of the owning company
                and its assets, it is possible that Your PII may be transferred and, thus,
                disclosed to the receiving party on the course of the stated actions. According
                to the court’s decision on insolvency proceeding, if it takes place, in case of
                liquidation of the owning company, the liquidating party or the authorized
                representatives of the company can transfer, sell, dispose or license Your PII
                within the provisions stated by this court’s decision. In this case, it is
                possible that the owners of the PII shared on the Website will be notified of
                the forthcoming procedures and modifications upfront or the notification will be
                published openly on the Website. It is possible that acquisition, merging and
                other stated modifications are associated with a non-US company. </p>
            <p><strong>ii. Third Party Marketing</strong></p>
            <p>It is possible that Your PII can partially (excluding such sensitive information
                as SS number and banking and financial data) be shared for the marketing
                purposes with some of third party marketers, lenders and advertisers, we
                contract with. In this case, the receiving parties, as third part marketers, may
                use this information and share it with other third party marketers who may
                initiate marketing activity towards You in the way of presenting You the
                products You have expressed Your interest previously while submitting Your
                information. In case You decide to opt out from receiving such marketing
                messages and/or offers, You can easily unsubscribe and eliminate Your
                information from the lists compiled by these third party marketers to send You
                messages simply by using an unsubscribe option (option button or link) in the
                respective message. The means for marketing activity include but are not limited
                to direct mail, short messages, online banner ads, telemarketing calls, emails
                etc.). Apart from that, Your information can be used to track Your online
                activity and collect Your online behavioral and searching information. This
                activity is usually performed to improve the quality of the services presented
                to You online and adjust marketing activity to Your requirements and needs. </p>
            <p>Keep in mind that the way third party marketers use Your information is subject
                to the provisions of their legal documentation and regulations, including but
                not limited to the privacy policies and the terms of use of their websites and
                services. For this reason, since we take no obligations for the manner Your
                information can be used by these parties, we encourage You to acknowledge how
                Your information is to be used according to the provisions of the legal
                documentation of these third party marketers. If You wish to eliminate Your
                information from any of the lists or databases of these third party marketers,
                You should contact them directly. </p>
            <p>By continuous use of the Website and attempt to use the services presented on the
                Website, You expressly agree that You have read and understand the provisions of
                the legal documents, which control the use of Your information on the Website,
                and the terms of collecting, storing, sharing and using of You PII and the way
                Your shared PII can be used by third party lenders and third party
                marketers. </p>
            <p>In order to discontinue contacting with us and receiving more information from
                Us, You need to close this and all other Website pages. If You have already
                shared Your personal information with us and want to opt out from further
                communication and remove Your information from our lists and database, You can
                contact us directly with respective request using this email address
                contact@extralend.com or other contact information indicated on this Website.
                Your request will be processed and the information removed from our database. As
                soon as Your information is removed from out database, You can be sure it will
                not be shared with any third party, used for any secondary purposes, or used for
                marketing activities. Still, since the information has already been shared with
                third party marketers, we cannot take any responsibility for the communication
                sent to You by these third parties. You should contact third party marketers
                directly to remove Your information from their databases. </p>
            <p><strong>iii. Credit Implication of the Use of PII </strong></p>
            <p>The information shared with our third party lenders can be used to verify Your
                identity (via SS number and/or driving license number, for example) and Your
                information against national databases. Additionally, the lenders we contract
                with may need to perform credit verification and use Your PII to request a
                credit report from one or more credit organizations, including but not limited
                to the major credit bureaus, to determine Your credibility and assess the risks
                associated with providing credit products to You. Credit report request may
                lower Your credit score. If You continue using the Website and submit Your
                information via the online form on the Website, You give Your express consent to
                have Your information verified and Your credibility checked according to the
                provisions of these third party lenders’ legal documents used to govern and
                regulate their practices and communication with You. </p>
            <p><strong>iv. Email and Telemarketing</strong></p>
            <p>By agreeing to the Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy, You confirm that we and
                third party lenders and marketers with whom Your information is shared according
                to the provisions of this Privacy Policy can use Your PII for advertising
                purposes, including but not limited to email and telemarketing advertising. </p>
            <p>Your PII can be used for direct and indirect communication, including but not
                limited to telemarketing calls, assistance calls and credit product and service
                offers via the telephone number You have provided in the online form. Either we
                or third party lenders and marketers can use this number even though it is
                listed in any corporate, state, or federal Do-Not-Contact registry, suppression
                lists or the like. Since Your submitting of the information via online form is
                determined as an attempt to make a purchase or receive a service, the processing

                authorized to contact You upon Your given consent using telemarketing. Since
                Your inquiry to third party marketers and request for the service on the Website
                are also considered as a an attempt to make a purchase, according to ATSR these
                third party marketers are also authorized to contact You using
                telemarketing. </p>

                telemarketing campaigns. Your service provider may also collect Your
                information. These procedures and interaction with Your service provider are
                regulated by the policies and terms stated by these organizations and have
                nothing to do with this Privacy Policy and other regulating documents on this
                Website. </p>
            <p><strong>v. The Means to Collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information</strong>

            <p><strong>Pixel tags and web beacons</strong></p>
            <p>These small images are placed on webpages and emails to monitor the activity of
                users. These features record the activity of the user during the session, thus,
                enabling further adjustment and improvement of marketing campaigns and

                type, Internet service provider, platform type, date/time stamp, click records,
                referring and exiting pages etc. These files are also used to provide adjustment
                and improve user experience online and on websites in particular.</p>
            <p><strong>II. Privacy Management</strong></p>
            <p>In order to perform effective privacy management, we establish different
                practices on how we use Your information. Apart from the techniques to upgrade
                the level of Your online experience and the use of our service and the Website,
                we provide the options to limit the volume of information You share or eliminate
                Your information from our records upon Your request. </p>
            <p>If You do not want Your NPII information to be collected, stored, shared or used,
                You should exit the Website immediately. Still, it is possible that cookies,
                beacons and other tracing files are automatically installed. In this case, You

                adjust the default settings and request notification for cookies, accept or
                reject cookies, remove cookies from Your computer. </p>
            <p>Since the Do-Not-Track protocol has not been established yet, information
                security and privacy management is aligned with the provisions of this Privacy
                Policy and related documents governing the use of this Website despite any
                Do-Not-Track signals. If You wish to opt out from sharing with certain third
                parties, You can go to www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp to adjust
                Your options individually. </p>
            <p>Another way to opt out from tracking Your online behavior by third party
                marketers is to unsubscribe from their email lists via corresponding links. </p>
            <p><strong>III. PII Security</strong></p>
            <p>Your PII is collected, stored, shared and used under strict compliance with
                security and privacy protection regulations and practices. We shield Your PII
                and all the activity performed on the Website from any attempt of malicious
                activity, fraud, unauthorized use and other jeopardizing online practices. We
                exploit electronic, physical and managerial security measures to provide overall
                protection for the users of the Website and Website assets to avoid loss,
                misuse, unauthorized modification or deformation of any information. </p>
            <p>We limit access to the information and share Your PII strictly to the limit set
                by Your consent on the provisions of this Privacy Policy and other regulative
                means of the Website, as well as applicable laws. Within the company, Your PII
                can be accessed only by the authorized users and is never used publically. All
                the employees and other parties who have access to Your PII are obliged and
                liable to provide its protection and security to the extent reasonably possible.
                Non-compliance is subject to the disciplinary actions. </p>
            <p>Nevertheless, no entity can unconditionally guarantee that Your online experience
                will be 100% secured and no violation and/or illegal intervention can take
                place. The owner of the Website cannot take responsibility for any illegal
                activity, security breach, stolen or modified information, which happen beyond
                the owner’s control. In order to guarantee protection from any malicious
                activity from the outside, You can request to erase Your data from any listing
                or database You consider insecure. At the same time, third party marketers who
                receive Your PII are contractually responsible for protecting Your information
                to the extent reasonably possible. We provide verification on the diligence of
                our partners via multiple means and regulatory contracts and check their
                information security policies. In case any violation takes place, applicable
                laws and regulations are applied to manage the situation and eliminate possible
                negative consequences. </p>
            <p><strong>IV. Information Collection from Children</strong></p>
            <p>The information from children under 18 years old is strictly banned and will not
                be performed on the Website. We provide filters, which enable anyone of illegal
                age to provide information on the Website. In case we detect any PII received
                from a user under 18 years old, we will immediately delete this information.
                According to the fact that we do not voluntarily collect, store, share or use
                any PII from the users under 18 years old, we follow and comply with the
                Children’s Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA") and this Privacy Policy is built in
                consideration with the provisions of this Act. </p>
            <p><strong>V. E-consent </strong></p>
            <p>According to Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and national Commerce Act,
                the users who give their consent and e-sign electronic documents thus agree to
                receive documents, disclosures and notification in electronic format, provide
                the information via electronic means and allow sharing of this information
                according to the provisions of privacy policies, terms of use and other
                applicable laws and regulations and conduct business electronically. Once a user
                submits information through the Website, one gives consent to receive electronic
                notifications, documents and disclosures as well as the information provided
                directly on the Website and electronic communications with third party marketers
                and lenders we contract with. Any of such electronic communication received
                after providing Your e-consent should be considered “in writing” and have the
                same force and effect. The copy should be printed for records. </p>
            <p>We and third party marketers we contract with reserve the right to discontinue
                the provisions of electronic documentation, notifications and other forms of
                e-communication. In this case, the concerning users may be provided with prior
                notification of the case of termination in accordance with the provisions state
                in the policies and terms, regulating business relationship between the parts,
                as well as other applicable laws and regulations. The hard copies of the
                documents and records originated in the electronic form are not necessary to be
                produced and/or stored for the purpose of facilitation and expense reduction.
                All electronic records, disclosures and documents are to be destroyed according
                to the routine schedule and procedural practices as it is determined by
                regulatory requirements. Any of such electronic records can be considered and
                recognized as a legitimate evidence to validate rights, agreements and
                obligations, related to the parties bounded by the provisions of these
                e-documents or pursuant to these records. The time for validation, legal force
                and providing of such e-communication may differ. </p>
            <p><strong>VI. Links to Third Party Websites </strong></p>
            <p>The Website contains the links to third part websites, may contain the links to
                the websites of third party marketers. Since it works as a matching service, it
                may connect the users of the Website to third party lenders via links. The
                privacy of the information provided by the users on external websites are
                subject to the regulations stated on these sites and has nothing to do with this
                Website. Additionally, these third parties have their own privacy policies and
                regulative documents on their websites, and it is highly recommended to review
                these legal documents and disclosures individually prior to sharing any PII on
                their websites. </p>
            <p><strong>VII. Notifications for the Residents of Different States</strong></p>
            <p>We strictly follow the regulations and codes, both federal and state. The way PII
                can be used is regulated in states differently. Some state regulations require
                the party, which collects personal information, to disclose the complete
                information on how and in what periods the collected information will be shared
                and what other parties it will be transmitted to (individually and exclusively).
                Additionally, it may be required to disclose what types of personal information
                will be shared and in what manner it is supposed to be used by these third
                parties. In case the user of the Website is the resident of the state, where
                specific regulations are in force, we recommend to contact us directly using the
                contacts we provide on the Website to get all the necessary information in
                details. In this case, each request will be processed individually. We reserve
                the right to deny the processing of such request if the enquiry was sent from
                the user who legally reside in the state where such specific regulations are not
                in force. </p>
            <p><strong>VIII. Modifications and Changes</strong></p>
            <p>The owner of the Website reserves the right to apply changes to this Privacy
                Policy at own discretion and without prior notice. In case changes or
                modifications take place, the renewed information will be posted on the Website
                and the effective date of the document will be changed to the date of the most
                recent update of the Privacy Policy. By default, all the information is to be
                used according to the version of the Privacy Policy enforced at the time this
                information was collected. The user has right to determine individually if this
                rule is acceptable or not. Nevertheless, we encourage all the users of the
                Website to revise the Privacy Policy information and follow the dates of
                modifications to keep up to date and react in case it is deemed reasonable. </p>
            <p><strong>IX. Inquiries and Complaints</strong></p>
            <p>The users of the Website are within their rights to modify, amend and withdraw
                their PII collected on the Website. In case it is necessary, the user who
                decides to make changes to their own information should contact us via email
                contact@extralend.com or other contact details stated on the Website and provide
                inquiry regarding the modifications to be made. Similarly, if any user of the
                Website has any complaint regarding the operation on the Website and/or any of
                its service, this user should use the stated contact details and provide the
                details of complaint. We will review all requests and complaints in the shortest
                time possible and reply as soon as we can. </p>

                    Disclaimer: <strong>This service is not a lender and therefore cannot
                    determine whether or not you are ultimately approved for a personal loan,
                    nor can we determine the amount of credit you may be offered.</strong>
                    Instead, we facilitate business relationships between consumers like you and
                    the lenders in our network. Our purpose and goal is to match you with one or
                    more lenders from within our network who can provide you with the cash you
                    need. We will never act as an agent or representative for any of our
                    lenders, so you can rest comfortably in the knowledge that you will receive
                    fair and competitive offers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In order to request a personal loan through this website, you should
                    first fill out our short, easy and secure online form. Once you click to
                    submit it, this information will be forwarded throughout our network of
                    lenders who will review your details and determine whether or not they can
                    offer you a credit. Since each lender is different and we have no say in the
                    rates and fees you are charged for a loan, we urge you to take the time to
                    review the details of each offer you receive very carefully before you
                    accept or decline it. Once you have found a loan offer that works for you,
                    you will be asked to provide your electronic signature; this binds you into
                    a contract with the lender which means that you are legally obligated to
                    adhere to the terms in the loan agreement. You are never under any
                    obligation to accept an offer from any lender and you may cancel the process
                    at any time without penalty. We will not be held accountable for any charges
                    or terms presented to you by any lender and we are not responsible for any
                    business agreement between you and any lender.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We can not guarantee that completing an online form will result in your
                    being matched with a lender, being offered a loan product with satisfactory
                    rates or terms, or a loan product of the requested sum or on the desirable
                    terms, or receiving any approval from a lender in the first place.
                    Participating lenders may verify your social security number, driver license
                    number, national ID, or any other state or federal identifications and
                    review your information against national databases to include but not
                    limited to Equifax, Transunion, and Experian to determine credit worthiness,

                    participating lenders to verify your information and check your credit. Cash
                    transfer times and terms may vary from lender to lender. Not all the lenders
                    in our network can provide up to $3,000. The limits and regulations vary

                </p>
                <p>
                    The APR associated with your loan stands for the annual percentage rate, or
                    the amount of interest you will be expected to pay in relation to the length
                    of your loan term. Most of the time, the APR for personal loans can
                    reach  up to 1386.00%, though this can vary somewhat. Some states cap APR and the
                    amounts of charges for online personal loans.
                    APRs may depend on multiple factors like lender’s terms and conditions, type
                    and term of your loan request, state of residence, creditworthiness.
                    We're not able to supply you with an exact APR that you will be charged
					if you are approved for a loan.

                            If you are unable to repay your loan on time for any reason, please
                            contact your lender as soon as possible. Late payment fees are set
                            by your lender in accordance with the regulations in your state, and
                            lenders also determine their own policies in regard to how they
                            handle late payments. There are several courses of action that your
                            lender may take, so you should check your loan agreement for
                            specific information that pertains to your lender.

                            Financial Implications – The cost associated with personal loans
                            of up to $500 can range from 15% to 40%, and these costs may climb
                            even higher for loans that are greater than $500 in value. Before
                            you sign your agreement, you should check these fees carefully.
                            Similarly, there may also be charges applied for nonsufficient
                            funds. As an example, if your $100 loan is 15 days past due, you may
                            be assessed a charge that is equal to 10% of the principle balance
                            as well as a $25 nonsufficient funds fee.

                            collection practices rather than selling your debt to an outside
                            collection agency, and they will never sue you or threaten criminal
                            charges against you. Your lender may attempt to collect your debt
                            via email, postal mail, telephone, or text message, and they may
                            offer you a settlement so that you can repay your debt over time.
                            All of our lenders are required to adhere to the Fair Debt
                            Collection Practices Act which protects you from harassment. You can
                            contact your lender for more information about its specific

                            Lenders are within their rights to file reports with the three major

                            your loan. This negative remark will lower your credit score and may

                            Some of the lenders in our network participate in what is known as
                            automatic loan renewal. Simply put, if your loan is beyond a
                            specific amount of time past due, your lender will rollover your
                            loan. This may be offered to you in addition to options like
                            repaying your loan in full at a later date or repaying your debt in
                            installments over time. The minimum term for an automatic renewal is
                            15 days and you will likely be required to pay renewal fees and
                            additional interest charges.
