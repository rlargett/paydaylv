                that can provide credit products. Thus, the Company can connect the Users of the

                provided by the Company the User of the Website needs to complete the online
                registration form. </p>
            <p>We encourage all the Users of the Website to read these Terms of Use, as further
                exploitation of the Website, the use of the services on the Website and
                submission of personal information attempting request imply that You have read
                and understood these terms and other documents regulating the use of the

                for the residents of some states, including, but not limited to Arkansas, New
                York, West Virginia and Vermont due to specific regulations regarding short-term
                lending in these locations. The list of states is subject to changes. Please,
                check the status of Your state on Rates and Fees page using the links to
                authority Websites, which contain the recent and up to date information
                regarding online personal lending in the USA. </p>

                exiting its pages. </p>
            <p><strong>Company Services</strong></p>
            <p>As mentioned above the Company is not a lender and does not make credit
                decisions, rather connects its Users with independent third party lenders, who
                can provide the Users with personal loans of up to $3,000 (the amount of
                available loans depend on the regulations in each state). Since the Company has
                nothing to do with the credit decisions third party lenders make, the decision
                to approve Your request, as well as the amount and terms of the offered loan
                products are exclusively made by loan providers and depend in each individual
                case on many factors. The Company cannot guarantee that Your attempt to be
                matched with a lender will result in the approval of Your request, or that You
                will be offered the desired amount on the desired terms. Not all the lenders in
                our network can provide loans of up to $3,000. </p>
            <p>We encourage every User of the Website who has doubts about any particular loan
                offer or personal lending in general to seek professional consult and support,
                as this form or lending is a relatively expensive form of credit and remains
                effective only if used reasonably. Keep in mind, that the Company has nothing
                to do with the terms of any particular loan offer or credit product, thus,
                takes no responsibilities for the decisions third parties make and cannot
                provide information regarding any particular credit operation. </p>

                other governing documents of the Website and acknowledge that the Company takes
                no responsibility for financial or non-financial damages or costs associated

                    determine whether or not you are ultimately approved for a personal loan,

                    Instead, we facilitate business relationships between consumers like you and
                    the lenders in our network. Our purpose and goal is to match you with one or
                    more lenders from within our network who can provide you with the cash you
                    need. We will never act as an agent or representative for any of our
                    lenders, so you can rest comfortably in the knowledge that you
                    will receive fair and competitive offers.

                <p>
                    In order to request a personal loan through this website, you should
                    first fill out our short, easy and secure online form. Once you click to
                    submit it, this information will be forwarded throughout our network of
                    lenders who will review your details and determine whether or not they can
                    offer you a credit. Since each lender is different and we have no say in the
                    rates and fees you are charged for a loan, we urge you to take the time to
                    review the details of each offer you receive very carefully before you
                    accept or decline it. Once you have found a loan offer that works for you,
                    you will be asked to provide your electronic signature; this binds you into
                    a contract with the lender which means that you are legally obligated to
                    adhere to the terms in the loan agreement. You are never under any
                    obligation to accept an offer from any lender and you may cancel the process
                    at any time without penalty. We will not be held accountable for any charges
                    or terms presented to you by any lender and we are not responsible for any
                    business agreement between you and any lender.

                    We can not guarantee that completing an online form will result in your
                    being matched with a lender, being offered a loan product with satisfactory
                    rates or terms, or a loan product of the requested sum or on the desirable
                    terms, or receiving any approval from a lender in the first place.
                    Participating lenders may verify your social security number, driver license
                    number, national ID, or any other state or federal identifications and
                    review your information against national databases to include but not
                    limited to Equifax, Transunion, and Experian to determine credit worthiness,

                    participating lenders to verify your information and check your credit. Cash
                    transfer times and terms may vary from lender to lender. Not all the lenders

                <p>
                    The APR associated with your loan stands for the annual percentage rate, or
                    the amount of interest you will be expected to pay in relation to the length
                    of your loan term. Most of the time, the APR for personal loans can 
                    reach up to 1386.00%, though this can vary somewhat. Some states cap APR and
                    the amounts of charges for online personal loans.
                    APRs may depend on multiple factors like lender’s terms and conditions, type
                    and term of your loan request, state of residence, creditworthiness.
                    We're not able to supply you with an exact APR that you will be charged
					if you are approved for a loan.

                            of up to $500 can range from 15% to 40%, and these costs may climb
